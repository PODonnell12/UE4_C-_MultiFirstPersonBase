# UE4_Cpp_MultiFirstPersonBase
Every time I start a new game idea which is first person, requires multiplayer and also requires that other players have a 3rd person representation I spend so long re-doing the initial steps for each project then I get bored. This project is a way to have a starting point with the basics done to allow quicker prototyping of any such game projects

Steps covered:  
Create base third person c++ template  
Add first person mesh and animations from first person template  
Base game flow to enable remote multiplayer sessions  
Managing using different meshes/animations depending on locale of player  

Intended use:
Create a project using this as a template and get straight to prototyping!
